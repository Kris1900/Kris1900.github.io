# Hello World

Hi! This is my home page. My name is Krishna Patel, and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science!

### CPSC 120 Section 1


* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-salvador-and-krishna)
In Lab 5, Part 2, we learned how to create a program where we needed to find the arithmetic mean (or average) of a given expression. Doubles were interesting tools to use in this part of the assignment, to store floats for our equations to make them more accurate. It was a tough one, but really helped me understand the basics of coding.
* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-anna-and-krishna)
I enjoyed part 2 of this lab, and it's my all time favorite lab, since we were introduced on how to use a scoreboard for an earlier lab. Using booleans has helped me understand how to use functions based around its main premise of usages as well! It was difficult in the beginning, and now I know how to properly use booleans and play Blackjack as well!

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-eymrd-and-kris)
Part 2 of my lab was also really fun to play around with, since it was when we solely used arrays for a majority of a part. The usage of a simple 2D array has helped me understand how to use them more properly in future labs, and hopefully to make them more complex. We also used a non-zero return value to create a void function, which intrigued me to look more into that later on during this semester.
